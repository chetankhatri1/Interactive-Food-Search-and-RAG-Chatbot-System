# Interactive Food Search and RAG Chatbot System

This project uses a Python virtual environment and a requirements file to manage dependencies.

Quick start (macOS, zsh):

```bash
cd "/Users/chetan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/CK Learning/IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate/Interactive Food Search and RAG Chatbot System"

# create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# activate
source .venv/bin/activate

# upgrade pip and install
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# run a quick smoke test
python smoke_test.py
```

To deactivate the venv:

```bash
deactivate
```

If you'd like, I can add a Makefile or task runner to simplify these commands.
